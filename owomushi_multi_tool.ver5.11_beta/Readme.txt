https://youtu.be/zVfgmVu9DLs


Steps:

1. Enable debug in the pico headset.
2. download this and put the folder on the desktop. (extracted)
3. install Usb drivers if you have not already. 
4. go run region checker.bat 
		----PUT THE PICO ON YOUR FACE---

	Inside your headset open up apps 
		run pico factory settings. 
			
		change region to what you want.
5. open pico settings again in the headset and click bottom button
	then go to apps as you would in android 
		and clear data for these 3 apps 
	1:>  Pico Store 
	2:>  Matrix  (show system apps)
	3:>  User Center 


          -----NOW YOU ARE DONE WITH THE PICO----
(I included a 1app cleaner to clean cache much easier)
(can now be found in apps.)
now connect the usb again 

6.   run global store or china store whichever you want. 


7.  Login to your store you are good to go you are now region switched.
